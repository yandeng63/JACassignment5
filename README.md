Part 1 : 

Programming Assignment: ArrayList and Generics

Task 1: ArrayList Basics

1. ArrayList Operations:
   - Declare an ArrayList of strings named `wordList`.
   - Add the words "apple," "banana," "orange," "grape," and "kiwi" to `wordList`.
   - Print the elements of `wordList`.

2. ArrayList Manipulation:
   - Add "pear" at the beginning of `wordList`.
   - Remove the third element from `wordList`.
   - Check if the list contains the word "orange."
   - Print the updated `wordList`.

Task 2: Generics

3. Generic Class:
   - Create a generic class called `Pair` that stores a pair of elements.
   - Instantiate a `Pair` with an Integer and a String.
   - Print the elements of the `Pair`.

4. Using Generic Class:
   - Create another `Pair` with two Double values.
   - Print the elements of this new `Pair`.

Task 3: ArrayList with Generics

5. ArrayList with Generics:
   - Create an ArrayList of `Pair` instances.
   - Add the Integer-String `Pair` and Double-Double `Pair` created in Task 4 to this ArrayList.
   - Print the elements of each `Pair` in the ArrayList.

Task 4: Challenge

6. Challenge:
   - Write a method that takes an ArrayList of any type and prints its elements.
   - Test this method with both `wordList` and the ArrayList of `Pair` instances.



Part 2 : 
Programming Assignment: File I/O 

Task 1: Read from File

1. Read File:
   - Create a Java program that reads a text file named "input.txt."
   - Use FileReader and BufferedReader to read the contents of the file line by line.
   - Print each line to the console.

2. Character Count:
   - Implement a method that takes a String as input and counts the total number of characters (excluding whitespaces).
   - Apply this method to each line read from the file and print the character count for each line.

Task 2: Write to File

3. Write to File:
   - Create a new text file named "output.txt."
   - Write the following lines to the file:
     - "Hello, this is line 1."
     - "Java File I/O is interesting!"
     - "End of the assignment."

Task 3: Append to File

4. Append to File:
   - Open the "output.txt" file created in Task 3 in append mode.
   - Add the following lines to the end of the file:
     - "Appending new line."
     - "File I/O without buffers."

Task 4: Challenge

5. Challenge:
   - Implement a method that takes a filename and a String as input and writes the String to the specified file without using buffers.
   - Test this method by writing a custom message to a new file named "custom.txt."
